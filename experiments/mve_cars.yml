  persona: |
    Marcus, a 34-year-old software engineer living in Austin, Texas. He commutes
    35 minutes each way on highways and city streets. Married with a 2-year-old
    daughter, so car seat compatibility and safety ratings are non-negotiable.

    Budget is firm at $38,000 max - he's been saving for two years and won't
    finance more than that. Previously owned a 2015 Honda Accord that lasted
    180,000 miles, which shaped his trust in Japanese reliability.

    Priorities in order: safety ratings (must be 5-star NHTSA), reliability
    (wants to keep the car 10+ years), fuel efficiency (targets 30+ mpg combined),
    then comfort and tech features.

    Dislikes: overly aggressive styling, massive infotainment screens he finds
    distracting, anything that feels "cheap" inside. Test drove a Nissan recently
    and hated the CVT transmission feel.

    Considering: Would go electric if charging was more convenient in his apartment
    complex, but currently leaning toward hybrid or efficient gas. Wants Apple
    CarPlay. Likes the look of wagons and hatchbacks but wife prefers SUV styling.
